## Overview
Comparative analysis of CLAUDE.md templates to identify best practices and improvements.

## Template Comparison

### O4-MINI-BASIC-STARTER.md Analysis

**Strengths:**
1. **Comprehensive Best Practices Section**
   - Clear guidance on being explicit and direct
   - Emphasis on providing context and motivation
   - Good examples and role assignment advice
   - Structured approach with tags

2. **Detailed Project-Specific Instructions**
   - Explicit directory structure (.vibe/)
   - Clear file specifications for TASKS.md and ENVIRONMENT.md
   - Detailed order of operations
   - Emphasis on context documentation

3. **Practical Guidance**
   - Concise, modular CLAUDE.md maintenance tips
   - Memory and permissions refinement
   - "Explore-plan-code-commit" workflow
   - Safety considerations

4. **Additional Features**
   - Search functionality for current events
   - Privacy and safety guidelines
   - Cross-session state preservation

### SONNET4-BASIC-STARTER.md Analysis

**Strengths:**
1. **Highly Structured Task Management**
   - Detailed task format with ID system (TASK-YYYY-MM-DD-XXX)
   - Clear status definitions (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, BLOCKED, CANCELLED)
   - Priority levels and time estimates
   - Progress logging and completion criteria

2. **Professional Workflow Documentation**
   - Step-by-step execution workflow
   - Context management guidelines
   - Error handling and recovery procedures
   - Quality assurance checklists

3. **Integration Features**
   - Version control integration
   - Code documentation standards
   - Continuous improvement process
   - Quick reference commands

### Current CLAUDE.md Analysis

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Core Principles**
   - Documentation First
   - Structured Communication
   - Context Awareness

2. **Established Structure**
   - Already uses .vibe directory structure
   - Has basic file specifications
   - Includes maintenance protocols

**Gaps Identified:**
1. Missing detailed prompting best practices
2. Less comprehensive task format (simpler than SONNET4)
3. No explicit workflow phases (explore-plan-code-commit)
4. Limited guidance on parallel tool execution
5. No mention of program installation procedures
6. Missing required programs list (tmux, curl, jq)

## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority Improvements

1. **Enhanced Task Format**
   - Adopt SONNET4's task ID system
   - Add priority levels and time estimates
   - Include progress logging
   - Add task status definitions

2. **Prompting Best Practices**
   - Add section from O4-MINI template
   - Include examples of good prompts
   - Add guidance on structured communication

3. **Workflow Enhancement**
   - Add "explore-plan-code-commit" workflow
   - Include parallel tool execution guidance
   - Add search functionality documentation

### Medium Priority Improvements

1. **Required Programs Section**
   - Add tmux, curl, jq to required tools
   - Include installation procedures
   - Document tool usage patterns

2. **Error Handling**
   - Expand error handling section
   - Add recovery procedures
   - Include troubleshooting guidelines

### Low Priority Improvements

1. **Integration Features**
   - Enhance version control section
   - Add continuous improvement process
   - Include quick reference commands

## Best Practices Identified

1. **Documentation Standards**
   - Always include creation/update timestamps
   - Cross-reference related materials
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Maintain version history

2. **Task Management**
   - Use unique task IDs
   - Track progress with timestamps
   - Define clear completion criteria
   - Document dependencies

3. **Context Preservation**
   - Create topic-specific context files
   - Update context after task completion
   - Reference context in task descriptions
   - Archive completed work properly

## Research Findings - Best Practices from Industry

### Key Industry Best Practices (2025)

1. **CLAUDE.md Structure**
   - Keep concise and declarative (not narrative)
   - Use bullet points, not paragraphs
   - Write for Claude, not for onboarding developers
   - Include tech stack, project structure, commands, and code style

2. **Memory Management**
   - Project memory: `./CLAUDE.md` (team-shared)
   - User memory: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (personal preferences)
   - Can import files using `@path/to/import` syntax
   - Quick memory addition with `#` prefix

3. **Workflow Recommendations**
   - Use `/init` command to auto-generate CLAUDE.md
   - Store prompt templates in `.claude/commands/`
   - Implement "explore-plan-code-commit" workflow
   - Use model selection strategy (Opus for planning, Sonnet for execution)

4. **Project Organization**
   - Create custom commands for repeated workflows
   - Use git worktrees for parallel development
   - Maintain clear separation between shared and personal preferences

5. **Documentation Standards**
   - Be specific and precise in instructions
   - Periodically review and update memories
   - Document frequently used commands
   - Include architectural patterns and decisions

## Implementation Plan

1. Merge best features from both templates
2. Incorporate industry best practices research
3. Add required programs section with installation guides
4. Update task format to be more comprehensive
5. Include workflow and best practices sections
6. Add memory management guidance
7. Implement custom commands structure
